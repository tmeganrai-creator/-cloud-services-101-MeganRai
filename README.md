Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand IT resources over the internet. Instead of relying on your own computers or local storage devices, it allows users to save, access, and share data and programs by using the internet.
It deals with real-world vendors like Amazon Web Services (AWS), which gives infrastructure to complete software solutions. Microsoft Azure, which caters mainly to enterprise clients with its full range of services, and Google Cloud Platform which is very useful for building apps or dealing with lots of data.
